            Hello! My name is Chimamkpam Nnaji and I am from Enugu, Nigeria.<br> I love
            writing codes and playing soccer. I am currently studying Web Design
            and Development at BYU Pathway. My favorite snack is taco. I also love making music
            with my guitar. I have three close friends and every weekend we meet and hangout. This
            weekend, we went to the Calabar annual street carnival. It is the biggest street
            carnival in West Africa.
